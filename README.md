I am a full stack software engineer with a mathematical background. Having spent 8 years in the service industry honing my abilities in customer service and team work.
I first discovered my love for problem solving during my study of Maths at university. Similarly I have been able to find the same enjoyment in coding with solving bugs and creating DRY code.
